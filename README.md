# Pune House Price Prediction Project

link :https://pune-house-price.onrender.com

## Overview
This project is aimed at predicting house prices in Pune using machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, building a custom regression model, and deploying it using Flask to create a web application for predicting house prices.

## Features
- Data preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing Pune housing data for analysis.
- Regression model implementation: Building a custom regression model to predict house prices.
- Web application: Using Flask, HTML, CSS, and Jinja for creating a user-friendly interface to predict house prices based on user inputs.

## Skills Learned
- Data preprocessing techniques to clean and prepare data for analysis.
- Implementation of a custom regression model for predicting house prices.
- Development of a web application using Flask, HTML, CSS, and Jinja.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Flask
- HTML
- CSS
- Jinja
- Machine Learning (Regression)

## Project Structure
- `app.py`: Main Flask application file containing routes and logic.
- `templates/`: Directory containing HTML templates rendered by Flask.
- `static/`: Directory containing CSS stylesheets and other static files.

## Getting Started
To run this project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Run `python app.py` to start the Flask server.
4. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`.

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate more advanced machine learning models for better accuracy.
- Enhance the user interface with more interactive features.
- Deploy the application to a cloud platform for broader accessibility.
